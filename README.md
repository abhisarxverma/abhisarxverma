# 👋 Hey, I'm Abhisar

In **November 2024**, I found my purpose — **programming**.  
It wasn’t just curiosity, it was *heart connection*. I felt like I had found the one thing I could do every morning and every night — until the very end.

Since then, I’ve been on a journey to find **my field** in the vast world of technology.  

Right now, I’m diving deep into **Web Development**, focusing on **JavaScript**, and building small real things to strengthen my fundamentals — instead of jumping into frameworks too early.

## 🧭 What I'm About

I’m not here to chase hype.

Let’s keep building.  
Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.
