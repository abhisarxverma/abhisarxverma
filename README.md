# 👋 Hey, I'm Abhisar

In **November 2024**, I found my purpose — **programming**.  
It wasn’t just curiosity, it was *heart connection*. I felt like I had found the one thing I could do every morning and every night — until the end.

Since then, I’ve been on a journey to find **my field** in the vast world of technology.  
Right now, I’m diving deep into **Web Development**, focusing on **JavaScript**, and building small real things to strengthen my fundamentals — instead of jumping into frameworks too early.

> A focused, distraction-free task reminder.  
No flashy branding, just a clean space to remind you of what actually matters.

### 🖌️ [Thought Painting](https://github.com/abhisarxverma/Thought_Painting)
> A canvas for emotional release.  
Pour your thoughts into a dark, colorful screen — reflect, save, and breathe.

### 🔁 [To-Undo List](https://github.com/abhisarxverma/To_Undo_List)
> A twist on the to-do list: for regrets and second chances.  
Reflect on past decisions, reframe them, and start again.

### 💌 [Beautiful Mail](#)
> Why should only companies send nice emails?  
Now anyone can create emails with emotion — colors, buttons, and all.
