# 💟 Abhisar Welcomes you!

In **November 2024**, I found my purpose — **programming**.  
It wasn’t just curiosity, it was *heart connection*. I felt like I had found the one thing I could do every morning and every night — until the very end 😋.

Since then, I’ve been on a journey ✈️ to find **my field** in the vast world of technology. 

## **Current Stop - Web Development 💻**
### Next Station - AI Apps 🤖

Right now, I’m diving deep into **Web Development**, focusing on **JavaScript**, and building small real things to strengthen my fundamentals — instead of jumping into frameworks too early.

## 🚀 **Recent Webapps I deployed**

### [Errorhelp - My First Fullstack Webapp](https://errorhelp.pythonanywhere.com)

> I couldn't see developers share **Error Screenshots and Code in Chats** Asking for help, so I built this No-login, simple Webapp where developers can put everything related to the Error, the code files and Error terminal message ane more at one place in an **Erroframe** and share the link to the helpers, who can leave **help comments** on the Errorframe.

### [TypeTalk](http://typetalk.netlify.app)

> TypeTalk is a cool and fun webapp that lets you Talk in online calls without speaking a word—just type, and your voice enters the online call 📞. 
Perfect for noisy spaces, silent zones, or fellow introverts 😶‍🌫️ to talk openly.

### [To-Undo List](https://to-undo-list.netlify.app)
> A twist on the to-do list: for regrets and second chances 😌.  
Reflect on past decisions, reframe them, and start again.

### [Thought Painting](https://thoughtpainting.netlify.app)
> A canvas for emotional release❣️ .  
Pour your thoughts into a dark, colorful screen — reflect, save, and breathe.

### Beautiful Mail - Chrome Extension
> Why should only companies send nice emails?  
Now anyone can create emails with emotion — colors, buttons, and all 💌.

## 🧭 What I'm About

I’m not here to chase hype 😉.
I’m here to build honestly, learn deeply, and express what matters — with code.

Let’s keep building.  
Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.
