# 💟 Abhisar Welcomes you!

In **November 2024**, I found my purpose — **programming**.  
I felt like I found the one thing I could do from every morning to every night without getting tired — until the very end 😋.

Since then, I’ve been on a journey ✈️ to find **my field** in the vast world of technology. 

Right now, I’m diving deep into **Web Development**, focusing on **React** and the whole toolset around that, slowly turning the ideas from my ideas diary into deployed sites.

Also i have very sharp mind in Data Structures and Algorithms.

Just now on 29 september i deployed **TypeSmart** webapp.

### Next problem I am going to solve - 👨‍🏫 Smart Classroom Screen Sharing

> Will build a webapp that empowers teachers to view all student screens in one secure dashboard—making classroom management smarter and more efficient. No more walking around to check progress. Teachers can monitor activity, guide students in real time, and even share a student's screen with the whole class to highlight great work or explain concepts collaboratively.

## 🚀 **Recent Webapps I deployed [All Open-source]**

### [Typesmart](https://typesmart.pythonanywhere.com)

> TypeSmart is a chill typing webapp that helps you practice typing with your own content.
Instead of random filler texts, you can upload your own notes, book excerpts, or research material, make groups, organize everything in your library and type in a minimal, distraction-free interface. Both main and demo available in single app so that users can tryout the webapp without login/signup. [Checkout Repository](https://github.com/abhisarxverma/TypeSmart)

### [MyTuneTale - My First Fullstack React Webapp](https://mytunetale.pythonanywhere.com)

> I wanted to **practice React**, and i found no better thing to make than this, **Connect your spotify** and see your most **listened tracks** and most listened artists across three time frames - 30 days, 6 months and 1 year, See your monthly song addition journey through a line chart, Select any date you will see all the songs you added on that day and in that month. After completing this i came to know about the [Volt.fm](https://volt.fm/) site that does the same thing but more better and on more social level, still i deployed the site cause i had fun working on it.

### [Errorhelp - My First Fullstack Webapp](https://errorhelp.pythonanywhere.com)

> I couldn't see developers share **Error Screenshots and Code in Chats** Asking for help, so I built this No-login, simple Webapp where developers can put everything related to the Error, the code files and Error terminal message ane more at one place in an **Erroframe** and share the link to the helpers, who can leave **help comments** on the Errorframe. [Checkout Repository](https://github.com/abhisarxverma/Errorhelp)

### [TypeTalk](http://typetalk.netlify.app)

> I am an Intovert, so I couldn't talk in online voice calls in discord, so I build Typetalk, a website that helps you talk in online voice calls by typing and not speaking. Typetalk is nothing more than just a clean interface to manage the sentences and conversation you do by typing, you can save a spoken sentence, change voice, pitch, rate and volume, talk with fun voices 📞. Perfect for noisy spaces, silent zones, or fellow introverts 😶‍🌫️ to talk openly. [Checkout Repository](https://github.com/abhisarxverma/TypeTalk) 

### [To-Undo List](https://to-undo-list.netlify.app)
> A twist on the to-do list: for regrets and second chances 😌. Just put your things that you want to undo or to do better. I took UI design from Canva AI, but coded whole website myself in HTML, CSS and JS. [Checkout Repository](https://github.com/abhisarxverma/To_Undo_List)

### [Thought Painting](https://thoughtpainting.netlify.app)
> A canvas for cluttered minds❣️. I know it's hard to put the cluttered thoughts on a clean white paper, so I built this, just put your thoughts wherever you feel like on canvas, see how your thought painting looks with random colors and font sizes. [Checkout Repository](https://github.com/abhisarxverma/Thought_Painting)

## Other Projects
